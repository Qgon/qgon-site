			<p>I founded Qgon (~<i>kwy gon</i>~) as I felt it was time for a new challenge.</p>
			<p>After spending 20 years in various consulting firms – and having worked at medium and large clients in different roles –
			I decided starting my own company and working as a freelancer is the next step in my career.
			This will teach me new things, bring new opportunities and let me choose my own path.</p>
			<p>What I like about consulting is that it gives me the opportunity to work on multiple projects within different companies and meet new people along the way.
			The prospect of using and learning new technologies is also what I like as I'm very passionate about new technologies and innovation.</p>

				<h2>Passion for new technologies and innovation</h2>
			</header>
			<p>I have a strong passion for new technologies and innovation. I spend a lot of my time following, learning an trying new technologies.
			I don't see this as work but as a hobby.
			Another way I express this is by contributing to open source projects like Spring Boot, Micronaut and other libraries.</p>
